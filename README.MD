# YouTube insights with GPT
YouTube insights Stage CC Repo

**Project Vision Statement:**

*"Empowering Innovation: Bridging Startups and Investors for Ukraine's Economic Growth"*

**Overview:**

This project involves integrating the YouTube Data API, filtering for key metrics (like views vs. subs),
and using OpenAI (GPT) to analyze and summarize why these videos are succeeding.
Goal: Build an MVP that surfaces YouTube videos with strong performance relative to their channel size,
and uses GPT to generate insights around title, topic, description, or hook.

**Goals:**

1. Use the YouTube Data API to search and retrieve video data based on filters (keywords, date range, category, etc.).

2. Retrieve channel info (subscriber count) from channel IDs.

3. Filter and rank videos by a custom logic (e.g., high views / low subs).

4. Integrate with OpenAI (or similar LLM API) to:
    - Analyze video titles, descriptions, or transcripts.
    - Generate summaries or content insights.
    - (Optional) Set up transcription pipeline for deeper analysis.
   
5. Build a basic front-end dashboard or output CSVs for results.

**Deliverables:**


1. Accepts keyword/date inputs
2. Surfaces 10â€“50 top-performing videos from low-sub channels
3. Analyzes them using GPT to explain what makes them engaging
4. Simple interface (web-based okay for MVP)
5. Documentation on how to run and maintain the system
